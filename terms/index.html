If we modify the Terms, we’ll let you know either by posting the updated Terms on the Services or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or when you use the Services.

Your mobile network&#x27;s data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from your device.

If you want to use certain features of the Services, you’ll have to register for an account.

You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your Patch User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>The Services</strong></p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>About the Services</em></strong></h6><p>Patch’s Services allow you to find, compare, select, and purchase carbon credits, negative emissions, renewable energy credits, carbon removal credits, and similar assets quantified and tracked in the form of tonnes CO2e intended or anticipated to be avoided, reduced, or removed and issued as credits (“Credits”) from third-party negative emissions and carbon offset developers or registries (“Supply Partner(s)”). Patch facilitates that transactions and will provide you with the appropriate evidence of your purchase of Credits. Patch serves as an intermediary between you and the applicable Supply Partner. You acknowledge and agree that, in these transactions between you and our Supply Partners, Patch is an intermediary, not acting as a seller or reseller of Credits, nor is Patch a party to the transaction between you and the Supply Partner. Patch also provides API integrations which allow you to present offset estimates, project pricing, and Credit purchase opportunities to your end users within your own products or services, as well as checkout links which allow you to direct your users to the Patch site where they can purchase Credits via the Patch marketplace.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Pricing </em></strong></h6><p>You agree to pay all costs and fees associated with your use of the Services, including all costs and fees (a) presented in the Patch dashboard or checkout page where orders for Credits may be directly placed, (b) provided via the API if you are acquiring or offering Credits through an API integration, (c) written in an applicable order form (if applicable) that you agreed to, or (d) otherwise agreed between the parties. You also agree to pay any costs or fees associated with making payments or transferring money, for instance wire fees. For clarity, if you are using the Patch checkout links to direct your end users to a Patch checkout page where they can purchase Credits directly from Patch, the costs and fees associated with those end user purchases will be collected by Patch from the end users and will not be charged or invoiced to you, unless otherwise agreed.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>Payment Methods and Processing</strong></h6><p>We use a third-party payment processor to bill you through the payment method linked to your account or otherwise provided in connection with a transaction (“Payment Method”). You must provide and maintain a current, complete and accurate Payment Method and you represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any such Payment Method. </p><p>‍</p><p>Notwithstanding any amounts owed to Patch hereunder, Patch does not itself process payments. To facilitate payments made via your Payment Method, we use Stripe, Inc. and its affiliates (“Stripe”), a third-party payment processor. These payment processing services are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe terms and conditions and other policies available at https://stripe.com/legal and Stripe’s Global Privacy Policy available at: https://stripe.com/privacy (collectively, the &quot;Stripe Agreements&quot;). By agreeing to these Terms, users that use the payment functions of the Service also agree to be bound by the Stripe Agreements, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. You hereby authorize Stripe to store (and, if applicable, continue billing) your specified Payment Method even after such Payment Method has expired. Please contact Stripe for more information. Patch assumes no liability or responsibility for any payments you make through the Service. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your billing account upon demand. You authorize us to attempt repeat charges on your Payment Method if an initial attempt to charge fails.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Purchases</em></strong></h6><p>If you purchase Credits through an associated Order Form or through the Patch services, your payment amount (less the Order Management Fee) will be placed in an account and will be held by Patch on your behalf until the Credit is redeemed with the applicable Supply Partner. Credits for whole tonnes purchased that are issued prior to when the Order Form is executed will be fulfilled within thirty days from the date of payment, or earlier. Credits for whole tonnes purchased, but not yet issued when the Order Form is executed will be fulfilled within thirty (30) days from date of payment or Credit issuance date, whichever is later. Credits for partial tonnes purchased require the remainder of the tonne to be purchased by Customer or another buyer, and therefore, will be fulfilled within thirty (30) days from date of payment for the full credit or Credit issuance date, whichever is later. While we will strive to have Credits fulfilled on or before those deadlines, Supply Partners may experience delays in fulfillment for various operational reasons. In such a case where a Credit has not been fulfilled within the timeframes set forth in this section, you may choose to contact us to either request an estimate of the new fulfillment date, to request a replacement Credit be provided on a rush basis,or to request a full refund including the Order Management Fee. Credits are deemed to be fulfilled when Credits are either transferred to the applicable registry account or retired by Patch on your behalf, and the retirement documentation has been provided to you.</p><p>‍</p><p>Upon receipt of the amount owed by Customer for a Credit purchase order, Patch will reserve the appropriate allocation of Credits in Patch’s system to prevent any double counting or out of stock events, and provide a branded Patch certificate of allocation that includes a summary of Credits that Customer has purchased and the associated fulfillment status of each of those Credits.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Promotions and Discounts</em></strong> </h6><p>Patch may offer discounts or promotions (“Promotions”) from time to time, which may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar feature, product, or service. Any applicable sales and use taxes and services fees will be calculated based on the discounted Subscription value after the Promotion is applied. Certain Promotions may only be redeemed once you achieve a specified minimum fee threshold, and any sales or use taxes or service fees do not count towards achieving such threshold. Unless otherwise stated by us in writing, you may only use one Promotion at a time and cannot combine Promotions or any other discounted offers. You may not sell or transfer your Promotion. We may modify or cancel any Promotion at any time. If you violate these Terms, Patch reserves the right to cancel your Promotion.</p><p>‍</p><h6>‍<strong>Access to our APIs</strong></h6><p>The provisions of this section are applicable only to the extent that you access or use the Patch application program interface (“API”) endpoints, which allow you to make emissions estimates and Credits available for purchase to your own customers or third parties of your choosing. To the extent you do access or use the Patch API endpoints, you hereby acknowledge and agree to all of the provisions of this section.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Your Applications</em></strong></h6><p>Subject to the restrictions below, we grant you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable (subject to the section &quot;Intellectual Property&quot;), limited license to access our APIs and documentation only as necessary to develop, test and support an integration of your application (an &quot;Application&quot; or &quot;App&quot;) with the Services. You may charge for your Application; however, you may not add an additional mark up to the Credits on a per-Credit or per-purchase basis, nor may you sell, rent, lease, sublicense, redistribute, or syndicate access to any of our APIs.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Here Are the Rules</em></strong></h6><p>Your license to access our APIs and documentation is limited and subject to the following restrictions: you will not: (A) access our APIs or documentation in violation of any law or regulation; (B) access our APIs in any manner that (i) compromises, breaks or circumvents any of our technical processes or security measures associated with the Services, (ii) poses a security vulnerability to customers or users of the Services, or (iii) tests the vulnerability of our systems or networks; (C) access our APIs or documentation in order to replicate or compete with the Services; (D) attempt to reverse engineer or otherwise derive source code, trade secrets, or know-how of our APIs or Services; or (E) attempt to use our APIs in a manner that exceeds rate limits, or constitutes excessive or abusive usage.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Transparency &amp; Reporting</em></strong></h6><p>If you offer your Application for use by others outside your organization, you must maintain a user agreement and privacy policy for your Application, which is prominently identified or located where users download or access your Application. Your privacy policy must meet applicable legal standards and describe the collection, use, storage and sharing of data in clear, understandable and accurate terms. You must promptly notify us in writing via email to info@patch.io of any breaches of your user agreement or privacy policy that impact or may impact customers or users of the Services. Please review our Privacy Policy for more information on how we collect and use data relating to the use and performance of our websites and products.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Our Right to Suspend Access and Audit</em></strong></h6><p>If we believe that there is a violation of these Terms that can simply be remedied by your modification or update of your Application, we will, in most cases, ask you to take direct action rather than intervene. In such instances, we may use your name, address and other contact details to contact you or provide this contact information to any third party that reasonably, in Patch&#x27;s sole determination, claims that you do not possess all of the necessary intellectual property rights. In some instances, we may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action if you are not responsive, or if we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, our customers or users or any third parties. Patch also reserves a right to audit your Application to ensure it does not violate our terms and policies. You agree that you will cooperate with inquiries related to such an audit and provide us with proof that your application complies with our terms and policies.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Reservation of Rights</em></strong></h6><p>You retain your ownership rights in your Application and we own and will continue to own our APIs, documentation and Services, including all related intellectual property rights therein. All of our rights not expressly granted by these Terms are hereby retained.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Feedback is Welcome</em></strong></h6><p>The more suggestions we receive, the better our APIs become. Please submit feedback to us at developers@patch.io. If you send us any feedback or suggestions regarding the APIs or documentation, there is a chance we will use it, so you grant us an unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual, sub-licensable, transferable, royalty-free license to use any such feedback or suggestions for any purpose without any obligation or compensation to you. If we choose not to implement the suggestion, please don’t take it personally. We appreciate it nonetheless.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>Your Representations and Warranties</strong></h6><p>You represent and warrant that, if you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).

Automated messages may be played when the telephone is answered, whether by you or someone else.

We provide these references and links only as a convenience and are not responsible for the content, products, or services on or available from those third-party websites or resources or links displayed on such websites. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Patch is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize. Patch has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third-party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, Patch will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third-party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or service.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>Supply Partners</strong></h6><p>Patch has and will continue to assess the methodological legitimacy of projects listed on its platform across multiple criteria. Patch’s vetting process includes reviewing data and documentation provided by the Supply Partners, and also typically includes 3rd party evaluations conducted by certain groups including but not limited to Verra, Gold Standard, Climate Action Reserve, and American Carbon Registry. While all projects and their associated Credits will undergo Patch’s review and assessment before listing, not all credits will have been certified by an independent third-party certification body.</p><p>‍</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of any given Supply Partner or Credit within the Patch Services is not an endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of such Supply Partner or Credit by Patch. You also acknowledge and agree that it is not possible for Patch to verify the accuracy or completeness of all of the information that it obtains from or about Supply Partners. You acknowledge the possibility that: (a) Supplier partners may inadvertently or intentionally provide inaccurate information to Patch about themselves, their projects, or the Credits that they are offering to make available through the Patch Services; (b) Supplier partners may inadvertently or intentionally omit relevant information to Patch about themselves, their projects, or the Credits that they are offering to make available through the Patch Services; (c) Supply Partners may be unable to create, transfer, or certify certain Credits despite their commitment to Patch that such Credits would be created, transferred, or certified; (d) Supply Partners may experience business disruptions that cause them to be in breach of their agreements with Patch or otherwise unable to provide or certify credits which they offered for sale through the Patch platform, (e) similar errors, misrepresentations, omissions, negligence, or misconduct may occur on the part of Supply Partners which could cause them to be in breach of their agreements with Patch or otherwise unable to provide or certify credits which they offered for sale through the Patch Platform. You therefore agree that Patch shall have no liability to you, for any actual, financial, emotional, monetary, or reputational harms, in such cases of Supply Partner error, misrepresentation, omission, negligence, misconduct, or failure to fulfill their obligations to you or to Patch. In the event that you need to seek legal recourse against a Supply Partner, you may request Patch’s assistance in resolving the dispute with the Supply Partner prior to the commencement of any formal legal proceeding. </p><p>‍</p><p>In some cases, a particular Credit purchased may not actually become available. This might be due to operational failure, financial circumstances of the Supply Partner, delays that impact the vintage of the Credit, amongst other reasons. You acknowledge and agree that, in such cases, Patch will notify you and request that you select an alternative Credit or a refund, and that you must respond to Patch&#x27;s notice within 10 days in order to exercise your choice, otherwise Patch will select an alternative Credit for you. Patch shall not be liable to you for any loss or damage incurred in the event where a particular Credit or Supply Partner has become unavailable.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>Marketing of Credits</strong></h6><p>Any content or copy that you make public to promote, market, or describe the Credits or Supply Partner or your purchase of Credits must either have been provided to you by Patch, by the relevant Supply Partner, or otherwise approved by either.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>Disintermediation Policy and Fees</strong></h6><p>You acknowledge that Patch uses substantial labor and effort to provide the Services to you, specifically in identifying and contracting with Supply Partners to make their Credits available via the Services.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE PURCHASE OF CREDITS (i.e. Credits) ENTAILS INHERENT RISKS, ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE ESTIMATION AND REALIZATION OF THE ACTUAL CLIMATE IMPACT CAUSED BY THE UNDERLYING PROJECT(S), AND THAT PATCH SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU WHATSOEVER IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACTUAL CLIMATE IMPACT ACHIEVED BY THE PROJECTS UNDERLYING THOSE CREDITS OR VALUE OF ANY CREDITS.</p><p>‍</p><h6>‍<strong>Indemnity</strong></h6><p>To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, You agree to indemnify and hold Patch, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and Supply Partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account or claims by your customers arising from their use of the Services through your products), (b) your violation of these Terms, and (c) your violation of a Supply Partner’s rules, policies, terms of service, or any agreement between you and a Supply Partner.

You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Patch are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>(b) Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</em></strong> </h6><p>YOU AND PATCH AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND PATCH AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>(c) Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</strong></h6><p>Patch is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at into@patch.io. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Patch should be sent to Patch Technologies, Inc., 249 Hickory Street, San Francisco, CA 94102, Attn: Legal (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Patch and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Patch may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Patch or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Patch is entitled.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>(d) Arbitration Procedures</strong></h6><p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for commercial disputes can be found at the AAA’s commercial arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/commercial. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms  and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless Patch and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Patch agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>(e) Costs of Arbitration</strong></h6><p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>(f) Confidentiality</strong></h6><p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>(g) Severability</strong> </h6><p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>(h) Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</strong></h6><p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, Patch agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Patch written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>Governing Law and Venue</strong></h6><p>Except as otherwise provided in the Arbitration section, these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, you hereby agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the Northern District of California.</p><p>‍</p><h6>‍<strong>Survival</strong></h6><p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, disclaimers, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>Electronic Signatures</strong></h6><p>For some activities related to the Services, Patch may permit you to use a personal computer equipped with an active connection to an internet service provider to access your accounts and documents and to perform certain transactions as available. To facilitate this, you may be given the option to sign or agree to certain documents including, but not limited to, quotes, updates, notifications or other information that you request, transaction receipts, documents requiring your signature, or any other documents (“Communications”) electronically by either checking the appropriate box or engaging in a similar online process as instructed online. You agree that by checking the appropriate box within or adjacent to the applicable Communication or engaging in a similar online electronic consent process, you are providing your electronic signature and agree to be bound by the terms and provisions such Communication just as if you had signed your name to a paper document.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Taxes and Reporting</em></strong></h6><p>You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Patch may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Use of Marks</em></strong></h6><p>While the Agreement is in force, you agree that, to the extent you provide such things to Patch, Patch may include your company logo and profile on any web site it maintains for customers of Patch’s services, and you hereby grant the license necessary for Patch to do so. You consent to publication of your company’s name by Patch as a Patch customer.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Non-Waiver and Enforceability</em></strong></h6><p>The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Except as otherwise stated herein, if any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable, except as otherwise provided in the Arbitration provision.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Complete Agreement</em></strong></h6><p>You and Patch agree that these Terms (including any applicable order form(s)) are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between Patch and you (including your employees, agents, and contractors), and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Relationship</em></strong></h6><p>You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venturer of Patch, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Patch in any respect whatsoever.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong><em>Third Party Beneficiaries</em></strong></h6><p>Other than Supply Partners which shall be third-party beneficiaries with respect to the sections entitled Limitation of Liability and Indemnification, you and Patch agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>Employment Opportunities</strong></h6><p>Patch is committed to the principles of equal employment opportunity. Applications are considered for all positions without regard to race, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, disability (so long as such disability can be reasonably accommodated), or any other status protected by applicable law. Patch encourages all qualified applicants to apply.</p><p>‍</p><h6><strong>Contact Us</strong></h6><p>Please feel free to reach out to us at anytime at info@patch.io.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="section_footer"><section class="footer_section background-color-slate"><div class="footer_padding padding-global"><div class="footer_container container-large"><div class="footer_layoout"><div class="max-width-40 align-center"><h1 class="heading-style-h3 mobile-max-width-18">Let’s get the planet back in balance</h1></div><div class="spacer-medium"></div><a data-w-id="0b745e5d-c938-64bb-72a9-5c75d703b137" href="../intake-form/index.html" class="button text-color-white w-inline-block"><div class="min-size-14">Talk to an expert</div><div class="button-arrow-wrapper"><div class="button-arrow w-embed"><svg width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
